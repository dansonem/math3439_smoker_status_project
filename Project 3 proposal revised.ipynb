Talk about the parts you think will be difficult (doing the modeling? preparing the data? keeping team members on-task?) and how you plan to address them. Specifically list out goals for yourself in terms of these challenges. I will check in with you throughout the semester on how you are progressing with these goals in order to help you succeed. Talk about why each team member was given each of their duties and responsibilities. Talk about your overall goals for the project. What are the things you are hoping to accomplish for this project to be considered a success? Is it an accuracy goal? Is it being able to explain a complex question in an easy way? Is it to add new insight to an important problem? Be as specific as possible. During your final presentation I will be looking for whether or not you achieved these goals, so they must be clearly defined and not overly broad."],"metadata":{"id":"V6gc4aX26uKZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In previous projects, understanding and cleaning the data has been a big hurdle. I think our dataset is pretty simple to work with, but there could be unexpected challenges to address in cleaning. Most of our variables are health related, and I think we'll have to do a bit of research to know what they mean, and maybe get an idea for what's considered to be in the healthy range and what isn't, ex. blood pressure that's too high or too low. I'm also concerned that making an accurate prediction model could be difficult. A person being in good or poor health could provide a prediction on whether they smoke or not, but I don't know how strongly the health factors provided are correlated with smoking. \n","\n","I'm hoping to accurately predict smoker status, and determine which factors have the strongest relationship with smoker status. For these variables, I want us to be able to explain their significance to the class. What does it mean if the average for hemoglobin is 16.9, for example?\n","\n","I am confident in my team's abilities. I distributed tasks based on our communications in Slack. I gave plotting to Eve and modeling to Sam to give them a focus, but I don't intend for their duties to be completely strict. Sam and I could also end up making some important plots, for example.\n","\n","Revision note: the dataset we originally saved was actually part of someone's competition submission that was posted on Kaggle. Dr. Savala found the original smoker status dataset, which we will use instead. It appears to be nearly identical, except for the gender column not being numeric, and an additional 'tartar' column that had been dropped in our original dataset."],"metadata":{"id":"CVgu_oKyojf6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Approved by Dr. Savala on: XX/XX/XXXX"],"metadata":{"id":"vVcSFuoXmmiy"}}]}
